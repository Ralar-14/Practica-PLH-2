      "besson's big mistake , i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject . \n",
      "yes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in besson's hallucinatory dream sequences . \n",

      "that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she's as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she's overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who's about to take a fall . \n",
      "as the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance . \n",
      "trouble is , he's chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it's impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent , nothing more than a put-on . \n",
      "this glib , pre-fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer's the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan's trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema . \n",

      "indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times . \n",
      "no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year . \n",
      "in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : \" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! \" . \n",
      "executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late . \n",
      "mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history . \n",

      "if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania . \n",
      "the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will . \n",

      "Text: there is a striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \n",
      "the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \n",
      "then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \n",
      "you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \n",
      "it is an important scene for several reasons . \n",
      "first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \n",
      "the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \n",
      "there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like \" angels in the outfield \" ( 1994 ) or \" michael \" ( 1996 ) . \n",
      "the angels here are stark and believable . \n",
      "this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \n",
      "there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \n",
      "they eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \n",
      "like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \n",
      " \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \n",
      "he first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \n",
      "maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \n",
      "angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it's not enough . \n",
      "he wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \n",
      "he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . \n",
      "he learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n . y . p . d . \n",
      "blue \" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \n",
      "sitting at a diner together , franz tells cage's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person's skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \n",
      "of course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \n",
      " \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender's haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" \n",
      "wenders' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \n",
      "the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \n",
      "and , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn't suffer extensive damage . \n",
      "this may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not an attempt to copy it . \n",
      "and yet , \" city of angels \" is not a typical hollywood movie . \n",
      "it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \n",
      "seale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \n",
      "while the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \n",
      "both cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \n",
      "ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \n",
      "cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \n",
      "what is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \n",
      "it's not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \n",
      "it doesn't give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \n",
      "instead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \n",

      "the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department . \n",

      "after leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses's people go . \n",
      "this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production . \n",

      "the film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . \n",
      "in addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features . \n",
      "but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . \n",
      "the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation . \n",

      "only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . \n",
      "as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . \n",
      "finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . \n",
      "because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? \n",
      "the people who had seen the film didn't think so . \n",
      "in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . \n",
      "for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . \n",
      "few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . \n",
      "but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . \n",

      "the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren't quite as well rounded as they should be . \n",
      "the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . \n",
      "elmer bernstein's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . \n",
      "the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . \n",

      "fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . \n",

      "one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . \n",
      "with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . \n",
      "there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \n",
      "the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \n",
      "the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \n",
      "we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \n",
      "later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \n",
      "the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \n",
      "this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \n",
      "the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \n",
      "in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \n",
      "but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \n",
      "eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \n",
      "we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \n",
      "two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \n",
      "it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \n",
      "he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \n",

      "everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \n",
      "however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \n",
      "by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \n",
      "everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \n",
      "but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \n",
      "for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \n",
      "the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \n",
      "at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \n",
      "this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \n",
      "he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \n",
      "the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \n",
      "in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \n",
      "however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \n",
      "the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \n",
      "for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \n",
      "and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \n",
      "ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \n",

      "still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \n",

      "and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . \n",
      "the only problem with \" slacker \" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . \n",

      "Text: the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of \" leila , \" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . \n",
      "although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . \n",
      "set in modern-day iran , \" leila \" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . \n",
      "as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet . \n",
      "earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . \n",
      "when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children . \n",
      "nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . \n",
      "bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . \n",
      "leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing . \n",
      "there are no easy answers to be found within \" leila , \" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . \n",
      "almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . \n",
      "maybe because \" leila \" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . \n",
      "leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . \n",
      "one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . \n",
      "it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \n",
      "although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \n",
      "ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \n",
      "these \" small \" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \n",
      "left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \n",
      "refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \n",
      "despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \n",
      "sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ? \n",
      "in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \n",
      "unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \n",
      "every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \n",
      "for all of its strong aspects , \" leila \" isn't a perfect film . \n",
      "on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \n",
      "and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \n",
      "mehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \n",
      "despite these minor missteps , \" leila \" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york's cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \n",
      "the thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila's self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \n",
      "it's difficult to not consider how leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \n",

      "in \" the natural \" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be \" the best there ever was , \" but still acted like a humble farm boy . \n",
      "in \" butch cassidy and the sundance kid \" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer . \n",

      "in his latest film , \" the horse whisperer , \" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . \n",
      "redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . \n",
      "despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase \" horse whisperer \" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . \n",
      "booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . \n",
      "the accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace's friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . \n",
      "annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . \n",
      "at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn't work . \n",
      "instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . \n",
      "in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . \n",
      "the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . \n",
      "in \" the horse whisperer , \" country is clearly the victor . \n",
      "the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie's controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . \n",
      "redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed \" a river runs through it \" six years ago . \n",
      "in many ways , \" the horse whisperer \" comes from the same poetic vein as \" river , \" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains . \n",
      "but then , that would ruin the magic . \n",
      "much of the film's photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . \n",
      "to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( \" natural born killers , \" \" platoon \" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . \n",
      "in terms of the story itself , \" the horse whisperer \" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's \" a brief encounter \" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood's 1995 adaptation of robert james waller's \" the bridges of madison county \" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted \" bridges \" ) . \n",
      "although \" the horse whisperer \" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . \n",
      "it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is . \n",
      "in \" the horse whisperer , \" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill . \n",
      "he plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . \n",
      "he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . \n",
      "there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . \n",
      "it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . \n",
      "as they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . \n",
      "it's a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . \n",
      "after all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . \n",
      "the best scenes in \" the horse whisperer \" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . \n",
      "although booker's horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . \n",
      "these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . \n",
      "at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . \n",
      "nevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . \n",
      "there are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . \n",

      "it may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn't require a magical faster-than-light drive . \n",
      "in the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . \n",

      "forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . \n",

      "Text: warren beatty's \" bulworth \" is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system . \n",
      "some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is . \n",
      "however , as loud and raucous as it is , \" bulworth \" speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear . \n",
      "beatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( \" the lemon sisters \" ) , stars as incumbent u . s . senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history . \n",
      "bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty's view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party . \n",
      "once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington . \n",
      "instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , \" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . . \n",
      "blah , blah , blah . \" \n",
      "when the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become . \n",
      "in a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place . \n",
      "knowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general . \n",
      "at a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they \" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife . \" \n",
      "later , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because \" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . \" \n",
      "all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth's chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment . \n",
      "platt has some of the movie's funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet . \n",
      "his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . \n",
      "when bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews . \n",
      "at this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience . \n",
      "bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally . \n",
      "she has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d . \n",
      " ( don cheadle of \" boogie nights \" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth's campaign . \n",
      "some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like \" boyz'n'hood \" ( 1991 ) and \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) . \n",
      " \" bulworth's \" chief liability is beatty's insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . \n",
      "instead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black . \n",
      "it's hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he's actually that incompetent . \n",
      "at any rate , the rap sounds more run d . m . c . \n",
      "than snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary . \n",
      "beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j . \n",
      "other than that , \" bulworth \" hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy . \n",
      "the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don't agree with beatty's liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics . \n",
      "unlike \" primary colors \" which opened earlier this year , \" bulworth \" doesn't try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead-on . \n",

      "i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \n",
      "squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't ) . \n",
      "miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round . \n",
      "so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \n",
      "the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \n",
      "in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna . \n",
      "patrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \n",
      "and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \n",
      "species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \n",

      "in lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians . \n",
      "these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed ) . \n",
      "this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well , \n",
      "you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) . \n",
      "moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) . \n",
      "in little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) . \n",
      "this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think . \n",
      "after all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) . \n",
      "movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too \" big \" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle . \n",
      "maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) . \n",
      "the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense ) . \n",
      "in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's \" kids in the hall \" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story . \n",
      "unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well , \n",
      "you'll see . \n",
      "the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots . \n",
      "one is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka . \n",
      "another , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw . \n",
      "and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint . \n",
      "of course , the movie does have its share of silliness . \n",
      "for example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head . \n",
      "in an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become . \n",
      "but what has he become ? \n",
      "a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? \n",
      "doesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . \n",
      "but let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . \n",
      "so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . \n",
      "while watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . \n",
      "but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left . \n",
      "although it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . \n",
      "i'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign . \n",

      "but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \n",
      "no no . . . \n",
      "just kidding . \n",
      "had you going there for a moment , didn't i ? \n",
      "in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \n",
      "the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants ) . \n",
      "the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \n",
      "unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \n",
      "the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \n",
      "i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \n",
      "the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve . \n",
      "there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \n",
      "and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \n",
      "mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \n",
      "shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \n",
      "thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \n",
      "one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \n",
      "too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \n",
      "i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \n",
      " * the acting is truly bad . \n",
      "sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n",
      " * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \n",
      "in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \n",
      "i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n",
      " * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \n",
      " * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \n",
      "for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n",
      " . . . unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \n",
      "in that case , the following critiques also apply : \n",
      " * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \n",
      "wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \n",
      "hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n",
      " * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \n",
      "sonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \n",
      "a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n",
      " * there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \n",
      "silly , silly folks . \n",
      "and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \n",
      "lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n",
      " * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \n",
      "motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \n",

      "taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . \n",
      "but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . \n",
      "so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment . \n",
      "like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . \n",
      "the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . \n",
      "al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle . \n",
      "and matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie . \n",
      "will is a troubled individual . \n",
      "as a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . \n",
      "an orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . \n",
      "now , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . \n",
      "he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . \n",
      "but he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . \n",
      "while working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall blackboards . \n",
      "then , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . \n",
      "will flees , but lambeau tracks him down . \n",

      "the judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . \n",
      "eventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . \n",
      "after a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . \n",
      "and , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . \n",
      "the script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . \n",
      "the characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . \n",
      "at one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a \" taster's choice moment . \" \n",

      " ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) \n",
      "director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . \n",
      "there's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . \n",
      "likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship . \n",
      "many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . \n",
      "matt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . \n",
      "minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it's refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . \n",
      "the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . \n",
      "arguably the best dramatic work in the actor's career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . \n",
      "adequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . \n",
      "like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . \n",
      "but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . \n",

      "although the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most . \n",
      "the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away . \n",

      "his performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . \n",
      "catherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves . \n",
      "her character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year . \n",
      "also fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director . \n",
      "as this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch . \n",
      "unlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives . \n",
      "lacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment . \n",
      "but director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing . \n",
      "schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point . \n",
      "also , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching . \n",
      "8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity . \n",
      "with a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller . \n",
      "ultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . \n",

      "admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . \n",

      "Text: the computer-animated comedy \" shrek \" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . \n",
      "for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . \n",
      "for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . \n",
      "all in all , \" shrek \" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . \n",
      "but first the basics . \n",
      "based very loosely on a 1990 children's story , \" shrek \" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . \n",
      "shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . \n",
      "petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the \" awk \" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . \n",
      "he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . \n",
      "as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . \n",
      "an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . \n",
      "lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from \" snow white \" has shown him the way . \n",
      "all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . \n",
      "the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of \" the dating game \" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , \" even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! \" ) \n",
      "farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . \n",
      "shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . \n",
      "they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . \n",
      "for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . \n",
      "the movie references a great many other flicks , from \" babe \" ( \" that'll do , donkey . \n",
      "that'll do \" ) to \" the graduate . \" \n",
      "but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . \n",
      "the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a \" possessed toy \" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , \" get that dead broad off the table ! \" \n",
      " ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like \" it's a small world . \" \n",
      "which brings me to disturbing point number one . \n",
      "i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . \n",
      "the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . \n",
      "for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . \n",

      "there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! \n",
      "the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . \n",
      "beyond all the irreverence , \" shrek \" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . \n",
      "it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature . \n",
      "do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? \n",
      "the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . \n",
      "adding short jokes is simply mean . \n",
      "still , \" shrek \" is a rollicking good time . \n",
      "the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . \n",
      "to trot out a clich ? , \" shrek \" is fun for all ages . \n",
      "parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing . \n",

      "this shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject . \n",
      "while a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob's belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large . \n",
      "we see close shots of people's faces , contorted by their rage . \n",
      "with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching . \n",
      "in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail . \n",

      "the film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c . \n",

      "Text: all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . \n",
      "in fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . \n",
      "still , the comparisons are inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference . \n",
      "no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . \n",
      "speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . \n",
      "speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davis ) meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep . \n",
      "what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate's speeches , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate . \n",
      "at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they let down their guard and become closer . \n",
      "but there are plent of obstacles in the way , including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics . \n",
      "the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . \n",
      "screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism . \n",
      "it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . \n",
      "part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . \n",
      "there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . \n",
      "inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . \n",
      "the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . \n",
      "davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . \n",
      "in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . \n",
      "for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . \n",
      "you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . \n",
      "perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . \n",
      "the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . \n",
      "he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . \n",
      "it might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . \n",
      "i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . \n",
      "but while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . \n",

      "the equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . \n",
      "the opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . \n",
      "another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . \n",
      "the technical side of the film is peerless , as always . \n",
      "the camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . \n",

      "yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . \n",
      "it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . \n",
      "throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . \n",

      "he cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . \n",
      "as if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler's list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler's monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller's last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . \n",

      "inheriting the mantle from last year's \" winner , \" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham's the rainmaker and good will hunting . \n",
      "damon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola's take on the rainmaker . \n",
      "damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . \n",
      "while rudy's ( and the film's ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . \n",
      "written for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . \n",
      "coppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy's unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company's hotshot attorney ) . \n",
      "the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . \n",
      "then , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy's often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . \n",
      "as good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . \n",
      "damon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . \n",
      "in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . \n",
      "good will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon's intelligent script touches . \n",
      "even though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will's burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . \n",
      "the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . \n",
      "williams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will's best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will's harvard-schooled love interest . \n",
      "the clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will's prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . \n",
      "so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham's the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come . \n",

      "Text: the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : \" it mu5t be found . \" \n",
      "so what , exactly , is the fifth element ? \n",
      "after seeing luc besson's ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . \n",
      "but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . \n",
      "the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . \n",
      "speaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . \n",
      "figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson's the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . \n",
      "all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . \n",
      "what remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . \n",
      "the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . \n",
      "the frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . \n",
      "but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting , and are they ever . \n",
      "in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna's pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . \n",
      "gaulthier's outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson's futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . \n",
      "while besson's bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . \n",
      "for all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . \n",
      "i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . \n",
      "at first this character's hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . \n",
      "not irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . \n",
      "the tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra's innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . \n",
      "then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . \n",
      "the story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . \n",
      "while still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . \n",
      "the big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . \n",
      "as such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . \n",
      "this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the \" enemy \" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . \n",
      "still , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . \n",
      "it is a fascinating example of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams . \n",

      "they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? \n",
      "stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare . \n",
      "and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded . \n",
      "shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year . \n",
      "it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written . \n",
      "it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love . \n",
      "joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) . \n",
      "he's commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) . \n",
      "shakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work . \n",
      "he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel . \n",

      "he discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex . \n",
      "but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed . \n",
      "shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter . \n",
      "i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care . \n",
      "he practically overflows with passion in every scene . \n",
      "fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in . \n",

      "of course , it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work with . \n",
      "stoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) . \n",
      "the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet . \n",
      "one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid . \n",
      "director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director . \n",
      "i'm going to have to see the movie again ; i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed . \n",
      "in fact , i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing . \n",
      "stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time . \n",
      "there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub . \n",
      "there's also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing . \n",

      "no dog ! \" \n",

      "the movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( \" rocky \" ) . \n",
      "after that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer's best friend . \n",
      "hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack's death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer's trail . \n",
      "here the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer's vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic . \n",
      "many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie , but they take on slightly different roles . \n",
      "for instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss . \n",
      "and , more importantly , hammer's suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic . \n",
      " \" i , the jury \" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane's books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code . \n",
      "although this takes the 1982 version of \" i , the jury \" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book . \n",
      "rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women . \n",
      "it features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself . \n",
      "no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling . \n",
      "it's no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor . \n",
      " \" i , the jury \" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn't do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made . \n",
      "the script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like \" it's alive \" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , \" q \" ( 1981 ) , and \" the stuff \" ( 1985 ) . \n",
      "cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget . \n",
      "he was quickly replaced by richard t . heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects . \n",
      "heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently . \n",
      "it shows in the final product . \n",
      "cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none . \n",
      "he shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull . \n",
      "the movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron's background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , \" i , the jury , \" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth . \n",
      "but the problems in \" i , the jury \" run deeper than the technical . \n",
      "the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties . \n",
      "because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona . \n",
      "we never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don't have hammer in them at all . \n",
      "consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane's storytelling is lost . \n",
      "the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind . \n",
      "despite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code . \n",
      "the title itself , \" i , the jury , \" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law . \n",
      "unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment . \n",
      "in this way , he can be seen as \" above the law , \" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality . \n",
      "the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms , but in any terms , especially his own . \n",
      "if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful . \n",
      "maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer's character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie . \n",
      "the blame for hammer's character can't be laid on assante's shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance . \n",
      "spillane never once described hammer's physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him . \n",

      "the intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it's never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . \n",

      "28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years . \n",
      "director george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in \" the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition . \" \n",
      "the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica . \n",
      "as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land . \n",
      "for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety . \n",
      "shackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island . \n",
      "once on this \" safe \" haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization . \n",
      "he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world's roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia . \n",
      "miraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours . \n",
      "this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen . \n",
      "in the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war . \n",
      "the title of this fascinating documentary , \" the endurance , \" is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world . \n",
      "it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth . \n",
      "the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather . \n",
      "it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men . \n",
      "with astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey . \n",
      "the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow . \n",
      "after the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on . \n",
      "considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world's harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself . \n",
      " ( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary , \" south , \" an interesting companion piece for \" the endurance . \" \n",
      "if shackleton's original idea , document his trek across the frigid southern continent , had been successful , it would have been considered a super human feat . \n",
      "as you watch the story of \" the endurance \" unfold , you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent . \n",
      " ( shackleton's amazing 800-mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself . ) \n",

      "actor liam neeson narrates the story , but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale . \n",
      "the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material , both film and photo , in the documentary's first half . \n",

      "real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . \n",
      "to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . \n",

      "of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . \n",

      "she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . \n",
      "at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . \n",

      "the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \n",
      "this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \n",
      "his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \n",
      "simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \n",
      "the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" \n",
      "i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \n",
      "miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \n",
      "it's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn't playing like he's autistic . \n",
      "unlike dustin hoffman's performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio's in \" what's eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \n",
      "however , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \n",
      "hell , he doesn't even have to be shy . \n",

      "of all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \n",
      "i can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey's character is far too accommodating . \n",
      "not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \n",
      "the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \n",
      "the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn't rise to the challenge . \n",
      "the movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \n",
      "there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \n",
      "the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it's more suspenseful that way . \n",

      "usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \n",
      "this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \n",

      "a reference to payoffs in the police department , followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and a couple of pointed glances , is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty-five minutes ; even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory , with kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet for scott , that you may yearn for bickering buddies . \n",
      "worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain ( the always menacing michael wincott ) behind bars for far too long , leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica . \n",

      "for much of the film , he walks around with an intense frown , and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time . \n",

      "with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? \n",
      "of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984's \" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes \" ) down to the really bad ( 1981's \" tarzan , the ape man \" with bo derek ) . \n",
      "most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . \n",

      "for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . \n",
      "the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . \n",
      "and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet . \n",
      "yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . \n",
      "the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . \n",
      "the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . \n",
      "and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . \n",
      "there's a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it . \n",
      "jackie brown's lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . \n",
      "this isn't exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire . \n",
      "however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional . \n",

      "unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . \n",

      "making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \n",
      "what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \n",
      "the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \n",
      "chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \n",
      "the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \n",

      "also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \n",

      "almost . \n",
      "but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it's a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it's still a smart and insightful film . \n",
      "though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it'd be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness . \n",
      "we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they're really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis' character . \n",
      "lee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm's length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself . \n",
      "besides , it's witty , and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen's : that great woody allen feel . \n",
      "it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen's oeuvre , it's merely a blip ( no \" annie hall \" but it's no \" shadows and fog \" either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice . \n",

      "Text:  \" the faculty , \" the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995's \" desperado \" and 1996's \" from dusk till dawn \" ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996's \" scream \" and 1997's \" scream 2 \" ) , is being called a cross between \" invasion of the body snatchers \" and \" the breakfast club , \" and i don't think i could describe it any better than that . \n",
      "the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town . \n",
      "the six characters , as in \" the breakfast club , \" can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town . \n",
      "although the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e . \n",
      "casey is delilah's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don't have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one another . \n",
      " \" the faculty \" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original \" scream , \" and rodriguez , whose \" from dusk till dawn \" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's . \n",
      "williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer . \n",
      "the plotline of \" the faculty , \" involving aliens taking over other people's bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from \" invasion of the body snatchers , \" to \" the puppet masters , \" to \" invaders from mars , \" so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . \n",
      "surely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren't . \n",
      "the epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . \n",
      "the performances in \" the faculty \" were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . \n",
      "one exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . \n",
      "as members of the faculty , robert patrick ( \" t2 : judgement day \" ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . \n",
      "the standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . \n",
      "if there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . \n",
      "since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the \" queen \" alien , many of the faculty members disappear . \n",
      "it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . \n",
      "although not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , \" the faculty \" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . \n",
      "while the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren't human . \n",
      "and by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . \n",
      "+ note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . \n",
      "in actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan's buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . \n",
      "if i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving . \n",

      "that said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \n",
      "the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \n",
      "the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \n",

      "as i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \n",

      "william \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \n",

      "regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \n",

      "schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \n",
      "there was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \n",
      "with these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \n",
      "brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \n",
      "the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \n",
      "motss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \n",
      "in fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \n",
      "i think it's fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \n",

      "at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . \n",
      "ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . \n",
      "he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . \n",
      "on the basis of the overall story , \" at first sight \" is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , \" awakenings . \" \n",
      "what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . \n",
      "however , what helps \" at first sight \" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . \n",
      "usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer \" you've got mail \" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . \n",

      "the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . \n",

      "finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . \n",
      "the one misstep of \" at first sight \" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . \n",
      "very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . \n",
      "perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . \n",

      "in history jeanne d'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish . \n",
      "she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint . \n",
      "a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness . \n",
      "director/writer luc besson ( 'nikita' , 'leon' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft . \n",
      "besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend . \n",
      "he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain . \n",
      "he shows her as a human being . \n",
      "in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity . \n",

      "god is no longer her support . \n",
      "he has become her obsession . \n",

      "with the help of the wise yolande d'aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls . \n",
      "after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo . \n",
      "the movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere . \n",
      "the film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne's thoughts , imagination and conscience . \n",
      "besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle . \n",

      "the script needs a lot of polishing . \n",
      "except for jeanne , there are no real characters . \n",
      "and although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing . \n",
      "as for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task . \n",
      "in the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost . \n",
      "jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect . \n",
      "but though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( 'being john malcovich' ) and dunaway ( 'titus' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance . \n",
      "and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part . \n",
      "besides casting jovovich , besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting . \n",
      "there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder , pillage and betray with a smile on their faces . \n",
      "and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen , represented by the \" three musketeers \" of this story -- the brave gilles de rais ( vincent cassel ) , the wise aulon ( desmond harrington ) and the strong la hire ( richard ridings ) . \n",
      "though all those actor perform well , their characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the glory of france . \n",

      "'the messenger' has muscles instead of brains . \n",
      "there is some relief in the end , where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking . \n",
      "dustin hoffman's appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise . \n",
      "jeanne's character is unlocked , but whether god was in the picture or not , is never quite explained . \n",
      "was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge ? \n",
      "or was she truly a messenger of god ? \n",
      "the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious . \n",

      "the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \n",
      "in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \n",
      "on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \n",
      "a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \n",
      "there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \n",
      "nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \n",
      "while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \n",
      "overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \n",
      "when the designer declares that \" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , \" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \n",

      "are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? \n",
      " \" 54 \" belongs in the elite group of films known as \" the big disappointments \" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . \n",
      "i was heavily awaiting \" 54 , \" not the least because i've become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that's been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this \" edgy \" film . \n",
      "perhaps more importantly , \" 54 \" is part of the blossoming subgenre , \" the 70s nostalgia film , \" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with \" boogie nights \" and \" the last days of disco \" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from \" boogie nights , \" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others . \n",
      " \" 54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . \n",

      "Text: it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as \" raising arizona \" and \" the hudsucker proxy , \" made their feature film debut with \" blood simple , \" a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas . \n",
      "it bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens' recent \" fargo , \" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; \" blood simple \" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end . \n",
      "the premise of \" blood simple \" is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m . \n",
      "emmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz ) . \n",
      "things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme . \n",
      "to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening . \n",
      "every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the \" big picture \" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person . \n",
      "this aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film . \n",
      "the coens might have done well to title the film \" fear and loathing in texas . \" \n",
      "some have labeled \" blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else . \n",
      "the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive . \n",
      "that said , \" blood simple \" is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine . \n",
      "the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film . \n",
      "that said , \" blood simple \" is not exactly flawless . \n",
      "for one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder . \n",
      "and although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes . \n",
      "the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film . \n",
      " \" blood simple \" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it's a decent movie and it showcases the coens' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner . \n",
      "i would firmly recommend it to all \" coen-heads \" as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller . \n",

      "put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent . \n",

      "in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . \n",
      "at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , \" i love you , \" and john replies with , \" i know you think you do . \" \n",
      "the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . \n",
      "it's the kind that goes something like , \" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . \" \n",
      "it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . \n",
      "there's always the big but . \n",
      "john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . \n",
      "he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \n",
      " \" a great experiment \" , he calls it . \n",
      "brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . \n",

      "she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . \n",
      "in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . \n",
      "she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . \n",

      "that's why it's smaller than the refrigerator . \" \n",

      "brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . \n",
      "for example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . \n",
      "when they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , \" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! \" \n",
      "you don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . \n",

      "Text: with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \n",
      "their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \n",
      "the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \n",
      "that main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . \" \n",
      "the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! \" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! \" ) . \n",
      "these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \n",
      "if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug . \n",
      "they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \n",
      "the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \n",
      "unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude's car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . \n",
      "soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \n",
      "meanwhile , the big lebowski's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \n",
      "the plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . \n",
      "the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's \" run through the jungle , \" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . \n",
      "the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \n",
      "the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this \" jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \n",
      "there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not stand \" speech . \n",
      "the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose ! \" \n",
      "shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their \" peaceful beach community , \" and so on . \n",
      "by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least \" aggression \" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on \" passive , \" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . \n",
      "he also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn't like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . \n",
      "the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . \n",
      "i think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . \n",
      "audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \n",
      " \" it's good knowin' he's out there , the dude , takin' it easy , \" posits the narrator towards the end . \n",

      "slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery . \n",
      "at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999's \" the talented mr . ripley \" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . \n",

      "as donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000's \" the watcher \" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . \n",

      "giovanni ribisi ( 2000's \" the boiler room \" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . \n",
      "in the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000's \" wonder boys \" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . \n",

      "Text: synopsis : easily-angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce . \n",
      "diedre easily cons david's not-so-bright new wife molly into believing she's a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david's quick-tempered son , michael . \n",
      "diedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people . \n",
      "comments : the ex is a very bad movie . \n",
      "i haven't seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while . \n",
      "i kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars ) . \n",
      "as summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie . \n",
      "i'm not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000 . \n",
      "the ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn't take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind ) . \n",
      "those involved in the movie realize they're in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script . \n",
      "the ex's storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie . \n",
      "diedre , david's first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it's not as though she's bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime ) . \n",
      "david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger . \n",
      "though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made . \n",
      "molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she's a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son . \n",
      "time and time again , things do not add up in this movie . \n",
      "if a viewer can't accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex . \n",
      "if , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he'll probably like it much better . \n",
      "i don't mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp . \n",
      "even when viewed from an it's-so-bad-it's-good angle , this movie isn't all that successful . \n",
      "the ex does have its moments , though , almost all of which involve yancy butler ( the psychotic diedre ) and nick mancuso ( david ) . \n",
      "these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which , oftentimes , elicit chuckles from the audience . \n",
      "the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along . \n",
      "butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue ; every time her character kills someone , she has a punchline that's unbelievably inane . \n",
      "when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david , for example , diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states \" i'm so sorry , your lease is terminated . \" \n",
      "or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ? \n",
      " ( diedre's therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it's not her's . \n",
      "therapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies ) . \n",
      "having successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : \" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ? \n",
      "oh , that's right . \n",
      "'i'm sorry , but your time is up ! ' \" \n",
      "this is what passes for humor in the film . \n",
      "the audience doesn't necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can't believe they're watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . \n",
      "nick mancuso's chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler's character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . \n",
      "in between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie's best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is . \n",
      "in exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts \" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! \" \n",
      " ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) \n",
      "and so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . \n",
      "i won't reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . \n",
      "molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! \n",
      "molly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family's to spy upon them , that \" she's crazy . \" \n",
      "you'd be pretty crazy too if you'd rented this turkey . \n",
      "i'd avoid it unless it's on tv and you come across it . \n",
      "if you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn't spend money renting it . \n",

      "Text: melvin van peebles' \" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song \" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . \n",
      "it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . \n",
      "its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . \n",
      "in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , \" sweet sweetback \" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . \n",
      "van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built \" sweet sweetback \" from the ground up almost entirely by himself . \n",
      "because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . \n",
      "the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . \n",
      "van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself . \n",
      "he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . \n",
      "he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . \n",
      "for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases \" rated x by an all-white jury , \" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . \n",
      "he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . \n",
      "the storyline in \" sweet sweetback \" is deceptively simple . \n",
      "it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . \n",
      "one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . \n",
      "however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . \n",
      "acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . \n",
      "the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . \n",
      "although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . \n",
      "van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . \n",
      "at the beginning of \" sweet sweetback , \" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : \" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . \" \n",
      "van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . \n",
      "of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , \" sweet sweetback \" doesn't seem all that revolutionary . \n",
      "it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . \n",
      "at that time , \" sweet sweetback \" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . \n",
      "distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles' words , gave the black audience \" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . \" \n",
      "of course , once it caught on , it caught on big . \n",
      " \" sweet sweetback \" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates \" sweetback \" from other movies like \" shaft \" ( 1972 ) and \" the mack \" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . \n",
      " \" sweet sweetback \" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . \n",
      "however , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , \" sweet sweetback \" is certainly not without its controversies . \n",
      "when it was first released , an article was published in \" ebony \" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . \n",
      "there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . \n",
      "others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . \n",
      "still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . \n",
      "nevertheless , a movie like \" sweet sweetback \" cannot be made without conflicting points of view . \n",
      "it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . \n",
      "until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . \n",
      "the fact that \" sweet sweetback \" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply \" the black community \" ) . \n",
      "van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between \" sweet sweetback \" and all movies that had come before it . \n",
      "when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . \n",
      "near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , \" oh lord , let him die . \n",
      "don't let them kill him . \n",
      "let him die on his own . \" \n",
      "it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . \n",
      "and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : \" watch out ! \n",
      "a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . \" \n",
      "beyond the political aspects , \" sweet sweetback \" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . \n",
      "he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . \n",
      "he shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . \n",
      "he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . \n",
      "the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . \n",
      "watching \" sweet sweetback \" more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . \n",
      "arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . \n",
      "but there is more to the film than its racial aspect . \n",
      "the legacy of \" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song \" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him . \n",

      "in order for studios to survive , they have to make money . \n",
      "the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit . \n",

      "there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary . \n",
      "for some reason , it's never crossed anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit . \n",

      "the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . \n",

      "if this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average . \n",

      "the soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of \" nights \" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos . \n",

      "to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \n",
      "also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \n",
      "most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \n",
      "for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \n",

      "the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \n",
      "the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \n",

      "by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \n",
      "it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \n",

      "in exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . \n",

      "the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . \n",

      "what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . \n",
      "what drags braveheart down is its screenplay . \n",
      "it abounds with high production values : john toll's award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick's 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . \n",
      "but this does not save a misguided script . \n",
      "the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer's only response to his \" heroism \" is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . \n",
      "but wallace's actions paint a different story . \n",
      "he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . \n",
      "though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . \n",
      "wallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . \n",
      "after kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . \n",
      "this is evident of a \" spartacus complex \" , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . \n",
      "the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . \n",
      "it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . \n",
      "horner's score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . \n",
      "gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . \n",

      "the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge . \n",

      "note : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism . \n",
      "the message about hatred couldn't be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation . \n",

      "that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways . \n",
      "in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors . \n",
      "these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out . \n",
      "how they will all come together is the process the film deals with . \n",
      "i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general . \n",

      "things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences . \n",
      "this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug . \n",

      "once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . \n",
      "when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . \n",

      " ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre . \n",
      "it's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . ' \n",
      " ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner . \n",
      " ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations . \n",
      "even when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch . \n",
      " ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) . \n",
      " ? theme/theory : the film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it's more of a philosophical experiment . \n",

      "and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community . \n",

      "they not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays . \n",
      "it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon . \n",

      "moving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes . \n",

      "the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . \n",
      "first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is . \n",
      "barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . \n",
      "mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . \n",
      "labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . \n",
      "obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . \n",
      "another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . \n",
      "their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . \n",
      "if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . \n",
      "it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? \n",
      "what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? \n",
      "labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating . \n",
      "two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . \n",

      "cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . \n",
      "she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . \n",
      "she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . \n",
      "i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film . \n",
      "the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . \n",
      "the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . \n",
      "for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . \n",
      "one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . \n",
      "since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . \n",
      "are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? \n",
      "i don't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . \n",
      "often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . \n",
      "but what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end . \n",
      "although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal . \n",
      "in what way \" your friends and neighbors \" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . \n",
      "it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . \n",

      "in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech . \n",
      "at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . \n",
      "she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . \n",
      "drugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . \n",
      "but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . \n",
      "in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . \n",
      "even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . \n",
      "the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . \n",
      "it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . \n",
      "the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . \n",
      "with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . \n",
      "he becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . \n",
      "the girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship . \n",
      "it especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home . \n",
      "things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . \n",
      "it seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . \n",

      "lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl . \n",
      "the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . \n",
      "kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . \n",
      "the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . \n",
      "the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . \n",
      "the family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . \n",
      "that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . \n",
      "it will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . \n",
      "he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . \n",
      "the new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . \n",
      "the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . \n",
      "the storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . \n",
      "her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . \n",
      "she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . \n",
      "after all , the mystical trip is the journey . \n",
      "the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . \n",
      "bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . \n",
      "the little girls are precocious but they are lovable . \n",
      "julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . \n",
      "she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at . \n",
      "this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . \n",
      "and , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! \n",

      "Text: remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? \n",
      " \" pulp fiction \" and \" fargo \" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . \n",
      "that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing \" the way of the gun \" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be's but upon closer inspection doesn't look like anything comprehendable . \n",
      "it's a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won't allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . \n",
      "complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote \" the usual suspects , \" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . \n",
      "that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . \n",
      "you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that \" if it's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . \" \n",
      "with \" the way of the gun \" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . \n",
      "the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren't hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . \n",
      "they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . \n",
      "they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . \n",
      "along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the \" bag man \" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he's doing ) . \n",
      "the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can't call the authorities for help . \n",
      "his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . \n",
      "the exec's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . \n",
      "meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . \n",
      "mcquarrie doesn't know the meaning of the word simple . \n",
      "he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . \n",
      "everything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it's to the point of surrealism . \n",
      "nothing is what it seems in this reality , it's one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry's rules and regulations . \n",
      "every scene with caan's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about \" the business \" and how it works and we're hardly given a clue as to what they're talking about . \n",
      "these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they're more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet's trash . \n",
      "no one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . \n",
      "it's like a dream without any appeal . \n",
      "take the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . \n",
      "they sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don't move . \n",
      "the guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . \n",
      "you'd think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don't , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . \n",
      "there's a lot of things i didn't understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn't some yuppie or old rich snob , he's like a hippie straight out of the 60s . \n",
      "secondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . \n",
      "lastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country's army . \n",
      "if they were suicidal they wouldn't have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . \n",
      "there's a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . \n",
      "what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . \n",
      "absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . \n",
      "and it's all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . \n",
      "with any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . \n",

      "the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \n",
      "part of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n",
      " \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \n",
      "but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \n",
      "now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \n",
      "the plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \n",
      "thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \n",
      "part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \n",
      "park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \n",
      "but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us . \n",
      "another thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . \n",
      "there are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \n",
      "the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \n",
      "there's even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history . \n",
      "the \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \n",
      "when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \n",
      "consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \n",
      "out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \n",
      "why ? \n",
      "because once you got past the thought that \" they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \n",
      "they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \n",
      "conversely , \" chicken run \" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \n",
      "if you've never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \n",
      "even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \n",

      "the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \n",
      "ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \n",

      "the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet . \n",
      "poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . \n",

      "they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \n",

      "in fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \n",

      "of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \n",

      " \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \n",

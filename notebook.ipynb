      "departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel . \n",
      "totemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit . \n",

      "for the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality . \n",

      "in other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it . \n",
      "gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll . \n",
      "mel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt . \n",
      "so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors . \n",
      "but , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy . \n",
      "to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat . \n",
      "his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back . \n",
      "payback is often a very violent film . \n",
      "to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films . \n",
      "the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot . \n",
      "when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot . \n",
      "so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end . \n",
      "it's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities . \n",
      "in this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities . \n",
      "but hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him . \n",
      "my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive . \n",
      "gibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job . \n",
      "he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance . \n",
      "this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) . \n",
      "the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn't have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) . \n",
      "if i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn't have a bigger role . \n",

      "as he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he's so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor's lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . \n",

      "the voicework here is pretty top-level . \n",
      "tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan's best ape friend terk ; and wayne \" newman \" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . \n",
      "the movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals . \n",
      "when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . \n",

      "Text: the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \n",
      "martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \n",
      "unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \n",
      "seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \n",
      "this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \n",
      "goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \n",
      "the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \n",
      "at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \n",
      "after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \n",
      "three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \n",
      "wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \n",
      "but the perfect world of \" wiseguys \" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \n",
      "goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \n",
      "scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \n",
      "world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \n",
      "scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \n",
      "after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \n",
      "scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \n",
      "with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \n",
      "even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \n",
      "first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue . \n",
      "then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \n",
      "this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \n",
      "same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \n",
      "nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \n",
      "but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \n",
      "however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \n",
      "such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \n",
      "fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \n",
      "he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious \" a day in life \" segment near the end of the film . \n",
      "another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \n",
      "the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \n",
      "joe pesci deserved his \" oscar \" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \n",
      "ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \n",
      "liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \n",
      "liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \n",
      "lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \n",
      "paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \n",
      "as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \n",
      "because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \n",

      "chivalry has no place in \" lancelot of the lake , \" except as that of a dying ideal . \n",
      "bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood . \n",
      "bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . \n",
      "the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . \n",
      "since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films . \n",
      "we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness . \n",
      "but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . \n",
      "rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . \n",
      "lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . \n",
      "the greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur's wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . \n",
      "even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . \n",
      "he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . \n",
      "when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot's defense . \n",
      "it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . \n",
      "bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds . \n",
      " \" lancelot of the lake \" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . \n",
      "he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . \n",
      "the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . \n",
      "like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . \n",
      "all the actors he used in \" lancelot of the lake \" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . \n",
      "never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . \n",
      "instead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . \n",
      "in some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn't . \n",
      "the final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment . \n",
      "however , other times bresson's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . \n",
      "for instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses' legs . \n",
      "he does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . \n",
      "while there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . \n",

      "this new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . \n",

      "this is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . \n",
      "it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . \n",

      "while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear . \n",
      "thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . \n",

      "anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead . \n",
      "it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment . \n",
      "jodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals . \n",
      "and i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth . \n",
      "after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport . \n",
      "from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook . \n",
      "the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power . \n",
      "the irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right . \n",
      "it would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane . \n",
      "in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults . \n",
      "the complex role of ellie is an actress's dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge . \n",
      "she conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge . \n",
      "we root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far . \n",
      "contact is clearly foster's vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles . \n",
      "matthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film's weakest subplot ) . \n",
      "john hurt is effectively creepy as s . r . \n",
      "hadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . \n",
      "angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine . \n",
      "most memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances . \n",
      "zemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape . \n",
      "always known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact's visual effects are quite stunning . \n",
      "the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis's voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick's yet more wondrously pure . \n",
      "and zemeckis doesn't resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . \n",
      "effects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump . \n",
      "it says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it's not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised . \n",
      "the thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn't entertaining . \n",
      "for all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it's being sold as-- \" a journey to the heart of the universe . \" \n",

      "and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs . \n",
      "it's obvious he truly loves titanic . \n",
      "the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the \" heart of the ocean \" , which , according to bill paxton's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today . \n",

      "she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond . \n",
      "almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past . \n",

      "for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life . \n",
      "for rose , she is sailing to her doom . \n",
      "the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love . \n",
      "it's the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches . \n",
      "but as i said above , the love portion isn't sappy and doesn't \" weigh the film down \" , as some critics have said . \n",
      "it's sweet , and it didn't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories . \n",
      "of course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen . \n",
      "most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on . \n",
      "all of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch . \n",
      "of course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom . \n",
      "the sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing . \n",
      "it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths . \n",
      "the best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future . \n",
      "the crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose's story , now are totally aborbed by her . \n",
      "rose goes out onto the ship's ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard . \n",

      " \" star trek : insurrection , \" is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996's \" first contact , \" which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different . \n",
      "in , \" insurrection , \" however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement . \n",

      "like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . \n",
      "a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . \n",
      "the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . \n",
      "as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . \n",
      "recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . \n",
      "wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his \" one special thing \" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a \" big bright shining star \" . \n",
      "his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . \n",
      "the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . \n",
      "from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question . \n",
      "while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . \n",
      "it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film . \n",
      "while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . \n",
      "the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded . \n",
      "while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . \n",
      "a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . \n",
      "ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . \n",
      "it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . \n",
      "after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs . \n",
      "larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . \n",
      "however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . \n",
      "the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . \n",
      "if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . \n",
      "jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . \n",
      "in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of \" there are shadows in light , baby \" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's \" it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! \" \n",
      "rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . \n",
      "in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . \n",
      "much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes \" this is the best work i've ever done \" , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . \n",
      "mr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . \n",
      "while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane \" how much can you bench ? \" \n",
      "banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges . \n",
      "and while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . \n",
      "still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . \n",
      "in any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's \" sister christian \" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . \n",
      "if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . \n",
      "there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . \n",
      "mr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . \n",
      "similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat , sobbing \" i'm so stupid \" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . \n",
      "boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . \n",
      "while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . \n",
      "mr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard's georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . \n",
      "i'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . \n",
      "mr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it's wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . \n",
      "worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track \" you got the touch \" in a vain attempt at a musical career . \n",
      "mr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . \n",
      "ms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . \n",
      "consequently , it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp . \n",
      "her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she's essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . \n",
      " ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) \n",
      "and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham's parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant's drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . \n",
      "draw your own conclusions . \n",
      "perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . \n",
      "his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it's no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . \n",
      "while the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle's eyes makes the scene unforgettable . \n",
      "luis guzman's most famous work is possibly in brian de palma's carlito's way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who's a hanger-on to jack's group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . \n",
      "jack's eventual acquiescence to maurice's request leads to one of boogie nights' biggest comic payoffs . \n",
      "boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . \n",
      "striking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well-crafted , there's no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year . \n",

      "Text: star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \n",
      "review by matt pusateri \n",
      "few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars . \n",
      "the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \n",
      "arguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \n",
      "so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \n",
      "can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \n",
      "against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \n",
      "and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \n",
      "while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \n",
      "it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \n",
      "the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \n",
      "as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \n",
      "the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \n",
      "the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \n",
      "later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \n",
      "on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \n",
      "qui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \n",
      "as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \n",
      "complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \n",
      "while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \n",
      "if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \n",
      "the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \n",
      "but the complexity is not overwhelming . \n",
      "the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \n",
      "one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \n",
      "it's unclear whose story phantom menace is . \n",
      "in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \n",
      "but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's . \n",
      "if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation . \n",
      "lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \n",
      "on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \n",
      "the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \n",
      "neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \n",
      "mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \n",
      "portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \n",
      "the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \n",
      "individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \n",
      "but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \n",
      "in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \n",
      "the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \n",
      "in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \n",
      "there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \n",
      "individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \n",
      "this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \n",
      "but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \n",
      "many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \n",
      "first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \n",
      "the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \n",
      "each location is elaborate and complex . \n",
      "lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \n",
      "most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made . \n",
      "more than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \n",
      "the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \n",
      "watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \n",
      "of all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \n",
      "speaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \n",
      "with more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \n",
      "jar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick . \n",
      "jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \n",
      "the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \n",
      "however , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing . \n",
      "he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \n",
      "throughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \n",
      "you accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \n",
      "initially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \n",
      "on my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all . \n",
      "a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \n",
      "despite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \n",
      "fortunately , lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \n",
      "from the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \n",
      "in the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \n",
      "and finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \n",
      "from beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \n",
      "the pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \n",
      "the phantom menace won't win any major oscars . \n",
      "it probably won't beat titanic's box office record . \n",
      "and it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \n",
      "but it's an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \n",
      "the film can't live up to it's hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \n",
      "but it's still worth seeing . . . \n",
      "probably more than once . \n",

      "however , the character of denise really doesn't work with the film , when really thought about . \n",
      "she's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone . \n",
      "she's not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she's just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters . \n",
      "she may ruin the film more , but at least when she's on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves \" well , at least we'll be entertained . \" \n",
      "a couple other things that just don't work : mike's character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn't work at all : jenna eflman's uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn't work , but nice try . \n",
      "basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i'm giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do . \n",

      "Text: note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \n",
      "be forewarned . \n",
      "on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . \n",
      "although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . \n",
      "the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . \n",
      "the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . \n",
      "scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . \n",
      "and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . \n",
      "it's hard to understate this last point . \n",
      "mr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . \n",
      "indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional \" a film by wes craven \" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads \" written by kevin williamson \" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . \n",
      " ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of \" a film by \" is attained . ) \n",
      "and , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . \n",
      "in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . \n",
      "scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . \n",
      "while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging . \n",
      "like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the \" true life \" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . \n",
      "however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) . \n",
      "there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . \n",
      "flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . \n",
      "the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . \n",
      "they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . \n",
      "the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? \n",
      "there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) . \n",
      "any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . \n",
      "as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . \n",
      "one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . \n",
      "here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . \n",
      "the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . \n",
      " ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) \n",
      "indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . \n",
      "this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . \n",
      "while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . \n",
      "they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . \n",
      "it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . \n",
      "in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . \n",
      "their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . \n",
      "on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . \n",
      "she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine . \n",
      "given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . \n",
      "what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . \n",
      "the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . \n",
      " ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . ) \n",
      "but hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : \" no , please don't kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! \" \n",
      "look what that got her . \n",

      "slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going . \n",
      "in \" les vacances de m . hulot , \" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key . \n",
      "in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . \n",
      "while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . \n",
      "when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . \n",
      "tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . \n",
      "it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and \" les vacances de m . hulot \" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . \n",
      "tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . \n",
      "when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . \n",
      "tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , \" oh , he's not going to do that again , \" but , lo and behold , he does . \n",
      "for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one . \n",
      "then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . \n",
      "the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy . \n",
      "as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . \n",
      "the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . \n",
      "it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . \n",
      "instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \n",
      " \" les vacances de m . hulot \" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . \n",
      "anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . \n",

      "Text: casting \" doogie howser \" star neil patrick harris as mind-reading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of \" starship troopers , \" a hugely entertaining , mega-budgeted sci-fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven , who's making quite a recovery from his 1995 g-string epic \" showgirls . \" \n",
      "sure , \" starship troopers \" qualifies as cinematic junk food , but that's forgivable when the junk food is this tasty . \n",
      "everyone needs a high-calorie change-of-pace from fall's onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait , and \" troopers \" does the job admirably despite its flaws . \n",
      "for its first hour , \" starship troopers \" plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of \" saved by the bell \" and \" g . i . \n",
      "jane . \" \n",
      "in the distant years ahead , high school grad johnny rico ( casper van dien ) signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot , so the couple is broken up . \n",
      "but there's temptation awaiting both of them -- johnny's is in the form of an old friend ( dina meyer ) also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush , while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor ( patrick muldoon ) . \n",
      "personal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final 65 minutes , when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america , killing johnny's parents and destroying his home . \n",
      "our weakening , lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry , and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens' home planet , where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good . \n",
      "but the enemy is far smarter , more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for , and after an initial walloping , they must re-examine their strategy . \n",
      "the exposition -- played like a futuristic soap opera -- is silly , but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans . \n",
      "once we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous ( but never boring ) training sessions , \" starship troopers \" really kicks into high gear . \n",
      "its last half is all gruesomely violent action -- a fury of severed limbs , decapitations , disembowelments , brain removal , explosions and other jolt-inducers that are really going to please the 13- and 14-year-old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r-rated show . \n",
      "the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected , and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic , imaginative high point . \n",
      "it's nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren't too derivative of the titular menace from \" alien . \" \n",
      "these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights , especially the arachnids , a spider-scorpion-crab combo that's all sharp talons and even sharper legs . \n",
      "they attack in packs of hundreds , and it's a funny , scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl , jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined , gooey mess . \n",
      "it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ( ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot ) ; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous , bloody and immensely satisfying . \n",
      "the occasional dramatic moments -- one cast member's death , the final resolution to johnny's love triangle -- are botched , a testament to how \" starship troopers \" fails to create any strong , outstanding characters . \n",
      "these bland ken-and-barbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arm's length , but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la \" star wars , \" where even the slightest aliens had definite personality . \n",
      "the acting is decent ( but never spectacular ) ; most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory -- smallish roles on \" beverly hills 90210 \" and/or \" melrose place \" -- and it occasionally shows . \n",
      "van dien , for example , is limited but perfectly likeable . \n",
      "in smaller parts are the afore-mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny's best friend and jake busey ( gary's son ) as johnny's sidekick ; the latter excels at playing creeps ( see \" the frighteners \" or \" contact \" ) but seems off-kilter as a second banana . \n",
      " \" starship troopers \" is based on the novel by robert heinlein , a sci-fi writer who hasn't exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994's howler \" the puppet masters . \" \n",
      "but the overall familiarity to the \" alien \" trilogy -- and the promise of great gobs of gore -- could act as a crowd-drawer . \n",
      "its own possible influence , however , might well work against it when the franchise continuation \" alien : resurrection \" opens in a few weeks . \n",
      "we will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall . \n",

      "and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . \n",
      "no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat . \n",
      "about to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no' . \n",
      "the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . \n",
      "she can't go higher than him . \n",
      "he won't allow it . \n",
      "and what's amazing about \" election \" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . \n",
      "early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . \n",
      "it's like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . \n",
      "and it's amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it's happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around \" nice \" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . \n",
      "it's with mandy barnett's \" if you'll be the teacher \" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . \n",
      "sexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne's satire , or its success . \n",
      "it also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . \n",
      "satire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . \n",
      "it's a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( \" drop dead gorgeous \" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . \n",
      "payne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . \n",
      "we sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . \n",
      "minus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen \" ferris bueller's day off \" . \n",

      "Text: according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \n",
      "even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \n",
      "on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \n",
      "this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \n",
      "the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \n",
      "instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \n",
      "although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime . \n",
      "amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much . \n",
      "every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \n",
      "distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \n",
      "in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \n",
      "after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \n",
      "fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \n",
      "even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \n",
      "characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \n",
      "every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions . \n",
      "because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \n",
      "even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \n",
      "when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \n",
      "unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics . \n",
      "lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters . \n",
      "each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \n",
      "fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \n",
      "because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \n",
      "fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \n",
      "vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies . \n",
      "fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \n",
      "even the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \n",
      "on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \n",
      "this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota . \n",
      "his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \n",
      "that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \n",

      "since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . \n",

      "he has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . \n",
      "with that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment . \n",

      "however , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection . \n",
      "oddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body's cells . \n",
      "this only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . \n",

      "it's not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he's a great director and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \n",
      "and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \n",
      "it's worse than that . \n",
      "it's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \n",
      "or more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \n",
      "in certain circles , \" snake eyes \" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic \" rashomon , \" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \n",
      "in one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who's also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \n",
      "there's a big name in the crowd , and that's the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who's sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \n",
      "this all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \n",
      "what really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \n",
      "discovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \n",
      "as we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness' takes on what happened . \n",
      "this is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it's extremely interesting to watch . . . then \n",
      "it takes one wrong step . \n",
      "we follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \n",
      "but that's not the worst part of it : it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn't think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \n",
      "it only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can't rely on rick's investigation to be all that interesting . \n",
      "it's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \n",
      "events become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \n",
      "that's where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \n",
      "this time , it's a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \n",
      "what went wrong ? \n",
      "depalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \n",
      "depalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \n",
      "but granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \n",
      "at least his direction makes up partly for it . \n",
      "then there's koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character's flaws come to life like he did in depalma's earlier \" carlito's way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \n",
      "he can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \n",
      "he's flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn't so formulaic . \n",
      "a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \n",
      "he may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \n",
      "this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \n",
      "as i was watching the first half hour , i couldn't wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he'd be given , and perhaps he'd have to make a choice between who's he has to believe . \n",
      "now there's a film . \n",
      "unfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we've seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \n",

      "his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice . \n",
      "the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst . \n",
      "without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst's character , all that is left of conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement . \n",
      "on the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism . \n",
      "in the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another . \n",
      "the final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad's novel . \n",
      "its absence in the film is unforgivable . \n",
      "the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers . \n",

      "unfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script . \n",

      "poor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder . \n",

      "altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . \n",

      "rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . \n",
      "without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick's pain and frustration . \n",

      "it doesn't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . \n",
      "while \" the gingerbread man \" isn't in league with altman's greatest works like \" nashville \" ( 1975 ) or \" the player \" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . \n",
      "some critics love to stamp films like this as \" commercial , \" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don't make money . \n",
      "altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more . \n",

      "nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the '60s tv series ) . \n",
      "on one hand , nicholson's joker is extremely funny . \n",
      "his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . \n",
      "but on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . \n",

      "he is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . \n",
      "even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . \n",

      "Text: in december of 1996 , a little movie called \" scream , \" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens . \n",
      "first , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both \" scream \" movies , \" i know what you did last summer , \" \" urban legend , \" etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a 'la '80s john hughes ) , starting with last june's \" can't hardly wait . \" \n",
      "it may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : \" varsity blues , \" \" jawbreaker , \" \" cruel intentions , \" \" simply irresistible , \" \" the rage : carrie 2 , \" and \" the mod squad . \" \n",
      "coming april 9 are two more of this type : \" never been kissed \" and \" go , \" and on april 23 , we've got the teen satire \" election \" and the teen horror-comedy \" idle hands . \" \n",
      "jeesh ! \n",
      "out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum \" she's all that . \" \n",
      "although similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" a modern-day version of shakespeare's \" the taming of the shrew \" ( \" she's all that \" got its inspiration from \" pygmalion \" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985's \" the breakfast club . \" \n",
      "and to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn't have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in \" she's all that ? \" ) . \n",
      "the day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . \n",
      "although he doesn't know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won't allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . \n",
      "kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \n",
      "complicating matters , cameron's dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . \n",
      "as you can see , \" 10 things i hate about you \" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven't even mentioned , such as kat's shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca's materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . \n",
      "at a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of \" she's all that , \" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , \" you're vapor \" ) . \n",
      "since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . \n",
      "aside from a good screenplay , it's the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . \n",
      "aside from joseph gordon-levitt ( \" 3rd rock from the sun \" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . \n",
      "as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries \" the '60s \" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . \n",
      "even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat's way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . \n",
      "no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . \n",
      "heath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . \n",
      "one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . \n",

      "one off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school's staff act , which is strikingly unformal . \n",
      "allison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl \" chill \" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . \n",
      "although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . \n",
      "in one very funny scene , chastity asks , \" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? \" \n",
      "at another point , bianca and kat's father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's like to be pregnant . \n",
      " \" 10 things i hate about you \" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the '90s . \n",
      "it also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave '80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . \n",
      "by the film's end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . \n",
      "luckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about \" 10 things i hate about you , \" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten . \n",

      "after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof . morrison's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological \" geek \" side . \n",
      "by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there . \n",
      "this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies . \n",
      "however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r . \n",
      "hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive . \n",
      "hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) . \n",
      "this one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice . \n",
      "this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation . \n",

      "one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation . \n",
      "there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored . \n",
      "it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters . \n",
      "everything else was very one-sided ( e . g . \n",

      "lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table . \n",
      "the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega . \n",
      "it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory . \n",
      "in another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens . \n",
      "the concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction . \n",

      "freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast . \n",
      "as the movie gains speed , foster's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her . \n",
      "it is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably . \n",

      "suggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed \" the world according to garp , \" sold the rights to his novel \" a prayer for owen meany \" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn't grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names . \n",
      "that's an odd decision--irving claims it's to protect both himself and the novel--but it's one that doesn't unduly harm the finished product . \n",
      "irving's books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters . \n",

      "another drawback is that in the book , simon's condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail . \n",
      "watching \" simon birch , \" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended . \n",
      "simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith's rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he's forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film's director and screenwriter . \n",

      "first and foremost is joseph mazzello ( \" jurassic park \" ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon's best friend , joe . \n",
      "mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent . \n",
      "ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe's single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben . \n",

      "Text: fritz lang's first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town . \n",
      "joe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago . \n",
      "he is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can't save up enough money to marry her . \n",
      "she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher . \n",
      "before she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye . \n",
      "a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station . \n",
      "driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand . \n",
      "but the deputy sheriff \" buggs \" meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him . \n",
      "he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl . \n",
      "the sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect . \n",
      "locked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence . \n",
      "in the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping . \n",
      "fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can't get through to the prisoner's jail cell . \n",
      "the sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn't look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him . \n",
      "somehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies . \n",
      "katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died . \n",
      "the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses . \n",
      "joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge . \n",
      "he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob . \n",
      "an ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder . \n",
      "katherine , not knowing he's alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death . \n",
      "the defense claims that it can't be a charge of murder without a corpse . \n",
      "the trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn't have been at the jail . \n",
      "the sheriff also lies , saying he can't identify anyone in the mob . \n",
      "but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film . \n",
      "as for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe . \n",
      "in the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive . \n",
      "when the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened . \n",
      "katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . \n",
      "but don't blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive . \n",
      "mgm couldn't bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching . \n",
      "instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script . \n",
      "to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . \n",
      "his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . \n",
      "you couldn't help get the feeling that the citizens didn't care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves . \n",
      "their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren't going to be convicted . \n",
      "lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident . \n",
      "he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience . \n",

      "if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible . \n",
      "it is upon the film\u0012s execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before . \n",

      "the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . \n",
      "the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . \n",
      "decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . \n",
      "yes , most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . \n",
      "but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . \n",
      "the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . \n",
      "made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . \n",
      "it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . \n",
      "lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . \n",
      "he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . \n",
      "interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . \n",
      "lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o'harra , han's brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee's sister years ago . \n",
      "the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . \n",
      "the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . \n",
      "the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . \n",
      "on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . \n",
      "in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . \n",
      "the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . \n",
      "although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . \n",
      "it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . \n",
      "other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . \n",
      "fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . \n",
      "in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . \n",
      "i'm not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can't avoid to appreciate the difference from today's movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . \n",
      "so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don't like that particular genre . \n",

      "the media , however , is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill . \n",
      "the accidental shooting of ex-co- worker cliff ( bill nunn ) , a black security guard , becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam's honest ambitions . \n",
      "also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts , head of the news department of the station max falls directly under , and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander , who uses his network power to try and outshine max . \n",
      "alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities . \n",

      "she falls under max's wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting . \n",
      "kirshner's credits are relatively small for now , including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow . \n",
      "still , kirshner's character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda-bitchy-in-a-reserved-way roles . \n",
      "i wouldn't mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts , where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen . \n",
      "while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy , self-righteous monster has indeed been tackled before , mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability . \n",
      "hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors , and seeing them together is a real treat . \n",
      "they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters , and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both . \n",
      "there is quite a bit of humor in this film , and without it , it could've fallen into a drab , cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause . \n",
      "this isn't a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart , but it will lightly touch both , making for a recommendable movie . \n",

      "a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson \n",
      "this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's \" dracula \" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore . \n",
      "inspired by f . w . murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards . \n",
      "the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints . \n",
      "until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe . \n",
      "both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue . \n",
      "apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed . \n",
      "the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one . \n",
      "everyone knows the story of dracula . \n",
      "or do they ? \n",
      "his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt . \n",
      "jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown . \n",
      "upon seeing a photo of harker's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her . \n",
      "locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him . \n",
      "upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises . \n",
      "that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art . \n",
      "nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised . \n",
      "the film's surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising . \n",
      "there is much to enjoy , but i'll limit my praise to a few key points . \n",
      "holding the film together is kinski's remarkable performance as count dracula . \n",
      "past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp . \n",
      "but kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling . \n",
      "aided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula's vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease . \n",
      "this man is dreadfully lonely . \n",
      "he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust . \n",
      "kinski's portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting . \n",
      "when he dies , you almost feel as if this man's tortured soul has been freed at last . \n",
      "then there's the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh . \n",
      "it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it's quite impossible to imagine the film without it . \n",
      "popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments . \n",
      "when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums . \n",
      "the one i still listen to the most is \" tantric songs \" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken . \n",
      "it's a testament to the music's depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them . \n",
      "the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies . \n",
      "this is a timely re-release by anchor bay . \n",
      "after francis ford coppola's unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker's tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog's film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story . \n",
      "to some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made . \n",

      "that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film . \n",
      "such rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in . \n",
      "something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community . \n",
      "one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california . \n",
      "van dorn is worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would run from home . \n",
      "however , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film . \n",
      "infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast's investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself . \n",
      "unfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless . \n",
      "things change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) . \n",
      "almost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars . \n",
      "it is a real shame , because very few movies in today's hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt . \n",
      "in late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience . \n",
      "for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s . \n",
      "on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great . \n",
      "but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons . \n",
      "the new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called \" sexual revolution \" , same as all other \" revolutions \" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity . \n",
      "instead of being \" liberated \" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms . \n",
      "schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren't so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job . \n",
      "the difference between the two is simply in the line of work . \n",
      "many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda . \n",
      "on the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest . \n",
      "in the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn't deserve to experience parent's worst nightmare . \n",
      "the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen's fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda . \n",
      "van dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body . \n",
      "on the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn's ( his own parents wouldn't allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin . \n",
      "even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end . \n",
      "unfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale . \n",
      "the script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn't show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . \n",
      "apart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . \n",
      "but the content might be more than interesting for today's viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . \n",
      "until boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . \n",
      "hardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . \n",
      "the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn't be too surprising . \n",
      "anyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema . \n",

      "the body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands . \n",
      "both films are also flawed , but for different reasons . \n",
      " \" blood simple \" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow . \n",
      " \" shallow grave , \" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they'd accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending . \n",
      "the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end . \n",
      "as the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow . \n",

      "juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) . \n",
      "the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning . \n",
      "all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes \" shallow grave \" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next . \n",
      "other than the obvious question of why they don't report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills . \n",
      "i will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn't give away too much of the plot . \n",
      "broadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo's underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process . \n",
      "a police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective . \n",
      "david , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects . \n",
      "director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other . \n",
      "while i do not consider myself the \" happy endings are automatically stupid \" type , i thought that \" shallow grave \" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue . \n",
      "this could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional \" caper \" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more . \n",
      "granted , this isn't really a \" happy \" ending , but it's still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded it . \n",
      "i really shouldn't say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable . \n",
      "yes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i'd been cheated . \n",
      "still , \" shallow grave \" was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars . \n",

      " \" 8mm \" had a lot of promise . \n",

      "the most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \n",
      "i always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \n",
      "there is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \n",
      "because the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \n",

      "murnau was reportedly a giant man , well over six feet , a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance . \n",
      "which brings us to \" nosferatu : a symphony of horror \" : surely he felt a kinship with his title character , the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck ; in one of the most indelible images in film history , silent or otherwise , schreck rises from his grave , gnarled hands outstretched , and he's so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame . \n",

      "trouble is , murnau's monster is pale-faced , bald , pointy-eared , and non-goateed , and there isn't a single sexy , writhing woman to be found in his movie . \n",

      "their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie . \n",
      "possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . \n",

      "there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . \n",
      "the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . \n",
      "we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . \n",
      "but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . \n",
      "in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future . \n",

      "after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80's slasher movies , starting with 1996's \" scream , \" and followed by \" scream 2 , \" \" urban legend , \" and the original , \" i know what you did last summer , \" a film like , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" was bound to be made sooner or late . \n",
      "it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking , favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits . \n",
      "it has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean . \n",

      "it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" is made . \n",
      "i am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to \" ikwydls , \" which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a \" friday the 13th \" movie . \n",

      "dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \n",
      "the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \n",
      "dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \n",
      "it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \n",
      "quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \n",
      " * * * the review * * * \n",
      "released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \n",
      "director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \n",
      "the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \n",
      "dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \n",
      "the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \n",
      "the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \n",
      "it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \n",
      "most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to \" fold space \" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \n",
      "lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands . \n",
      "one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \n",
      "the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \n",
      "the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \n",
      "unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \n",
      "the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \n",
      "with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \n",
      "what a great idea ! \n",
      "why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \n",
      "the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \n",
      "thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \n",
      "the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them . \n",
      "and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \n",
      "dune is also a very serous film . \n",
      "the constant \" self-talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \n",
      "the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \n",
      "humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \n",
      "you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy . \n",
      "the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \n",
      "it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \n",
      "special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \n",
      "both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \n",
      "and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \n",
      "with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \n",
      "see it in the widescreen format if you can . \n",
      "and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \n",
      "sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends . \n",
      "as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \n",
      "the conclusion ? \n",
      "any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \n",
      "david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \n",
      "dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \n",
      "many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests . \n",
      "the extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \n",
      "in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director's cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \n",
      "but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \n",
      "in a way , then , it is partly lynch's own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \n",
      "stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director's guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \n",
      "he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \n",
      "certainly , looking at the results of mca's handiwork there's at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \n",
      "but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \n",
      "most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version's storyline . \n",
      "paul's relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \n",
      "the political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \n",
      "paul's initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \n",
      "and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \n",
      "as a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv's version of dune is clearly superior . \n",
      "as a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \n",
      "the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \n",
      "there's some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \n",
      "and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \n",
      "ships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \n",
      "this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \n",
      "it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \n",
      "but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn't even in herbert's book . \n",
      "the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \n",
      "its a surreal and disturbing episode that's very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \n",
      "despite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \n",
      "all up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \n",
      "unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we'll get to what the movie should have been . \n",
      "on repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \n",
      "still , as one of this century's great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \n",
      "with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \n",

      "the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . \n",
      "the other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here . \n",
      "edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . \n",
      "stopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . \n",
      "agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . \n",
      "this meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . \n",
      "just as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . \n",
      "the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . \n",
      "since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . \n",
      "allegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" \n",
      "the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . \n",
      "you honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . \n",
      "the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . \n",
      "and yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . \n",
      "you'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's . \n",
      "additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . \n",
      "playing sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . \n",
      "julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989's \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . \n",
      "it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . \n",
      "after \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . \n",
      "roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . \n",
      "an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . \n",
      "no only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . \n",
      "on the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . \n",
      "another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \n",
      " \" pretty woman \" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . \n",
      "this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . \n",
      "helped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian's best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment , \" pretty woman \" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy . \n",

      "Text: note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \n",
      "be forewarned . \n",
      "it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . \n",
      "the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . \n",
      "since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent . \n",
      "with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . \n",
      "while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . \n",
      "the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . \n",
      "what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . \n",
      "from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her . \n",
      "this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . \n",
      "one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . \n",
      "this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . \n",
      "while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . \n",
      "do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? \n",
      "is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? \n",
      " ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) \n",
      "fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . \n",
      "chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . \n",
      " ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber . ) \n",
      "similarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . \n",
      "he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl \" -- have become the stuff of legend . \n",
      "pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton . \n",
      "in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . \n",
      "of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman's untimely death . \n",
      "not only are mr . menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . \n",
      "mr . menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken's fine score . \n",
      "it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled \" under the sea \" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad \" part of your world \" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . \n",
      "during the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . \n",
      "as of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . \n",
      "there's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . \n",
      "in every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . \n",
      "but although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . \n",
      "any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . \n",
      "the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney's modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made . \n",

      "Text: some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s . \n",
      "since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . \n",
      "bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account . \n",
      "it's rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . \n",
      "raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . \n",
      "the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . \n",
      "for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . \n",
      "historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . \n",
      "however , although la motta is credited as the movie's \" consultant , \" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . \n",
      "the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . \n",
      "sex and violence are inextricably linked . \n",
      "the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . \n",
      "in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . \n",
      "outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . \n",
      "the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . \n",
      "these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . \n",
      "he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . \n",
      "raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . \n",
      "over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . \n",
      "meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . \n",
      "vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . \n",
      "his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . \n",
      "hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . \n",
      " ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? \" ) \n",
      "in the late '40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . \n",
      "he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . \n",
      "two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . \n",
      "by the late '50s and early '60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . \n",
      "raging bull is the other side of rocky . \n",
      "sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . \n",
      "it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . \n",
      "but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . \n",
      "while scorsese's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . \n",
      "rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . \n",
      "there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance . \n",
      "in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . \n",
      "the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . \n",
      "and , although there's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . \n",
      "this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . \n",
      "as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . \n",
      "as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . \n",
      "how many actors would go that far ? \n",
      "the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . \n",
      "cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . \n",
      "their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro's . \n",
      "pesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . \n",
      "the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . \n",
      "but , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it's startling to behold . \n",
      "moriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . \n",
      "later , she's called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . \n",
      "scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) . \n",
      "the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of . \n",
      " ( one important recent exception , schindler's list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) \n",
      "in black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese's choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . \n",
      "there's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . \n",
      "during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta's perspective . \n",
      "scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta's loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . \n",
      "after that , his career was all downhill . \n",
      "yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta's future . \n",
      "the reason is obvious : scorsese isn't as interested in boxing as he is in the character . \n",
      "following his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . \n",
      "we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . \n",
      "who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando's speech from on the waterfront ? \n",

      "at the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . \n",
      "this highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \n",
      "and with good reason . \n",
      "this is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \n",
      "remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \n",
      " ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \n",
      "uma thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \n",
      "unfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \n",
      "at this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \n",
      "the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \n",
      "when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \n",
      "if nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \n",
      "the story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \n",
      " ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \n",
      "overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \n",
      "the avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \n",
      "mr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \n",

      "by the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \n",

      " ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . \n",

      "ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . \n",

      "i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place . \n",
      "to be sure , \" gloria \" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . \n",
      "right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . \n",
      "eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . \n",

      "gloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . \n",
      "the previous incarnation of \" gloria \" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . \n",
      "there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch . \n",
      "i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . \n",
      "these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . \n",
      "throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , \" who really cares ? \" \n",
      "as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn't sound realistic at all . \n",
      "in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . \n",
      "although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . \n",
      "jean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . \n",
      "all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria's friend whom she turns to for help . \n",

      "they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . \n",
      "although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular \" in dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . \n",
      "although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995's \" casino \" or 1996's \" last dance \" if you don't believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . \n",

      "the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \n",
      "professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \n",
      "this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \n",
      "a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \n",
      "will finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \n",
      "he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \n",
      "what makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will's life . \n",
      "the script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \n",
      "lambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we're not sure if we like what he has to say . \n",
      "and sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \n",
      "will's reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \n",
      "for a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \n",
      "this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \n",

      "will's relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the 'f' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will's character . \n",
      "add all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven't given this film four stars . \n",
      "well , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \n",

      "although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . \n",
      "until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . \n",
      "contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . \n",
      "one of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin's to live and die in l . a . \n",
      "the money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . \n",
      "rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . \n",
      "richard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . \n",

      "that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . \n",
      "secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . \n",
      "ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . \n",
      "willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn't seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . \n",

      "the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . \n",

      "the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film . \n",
      "the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach . \n",

      "these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating . \n",
      "the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized . \n",

      "by the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . \n",

      "every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . \n",

      "however , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . \n",
      "as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . \n",
      "what had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . \n",

    "predict_sentiment(\"\"\"The word that will likely be used most often to describe Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Two” is “massive.” Expect a whole lot of variations on the words “epic” and “spectacle” too. Whatever big words you apply to the result, Villeneuve undeniably did not approach Frank Herbert’s beloved sci-fi novel with modest aspirations, and it’s his ambition, along with the top tier of behind-the-scenes craftspeople with whom he collaborated, that have paid off in this superior follow-up to the Oscar-winning 2021 film. While that beloved blockbuster often felt like half a film, “Dune: Part Two” locates significantly higher stakes on Arrakis, while injecting just enough humor and nuanced themes about power and fanaticism to flavor the old-fashioned storytelling. More than a simple savior or chosen one story, “Dune: Part Two” is a robust piece of filmmaking, a reminder that this kind of broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Dune: Part Two” picks up so closely on the heels of the first film that the Fremen are still transporting the body of Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) home again after he was bested in the fight with Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet). After the massacre of House Atreides, Paul chose to go with the Fremen, much to the consternation of his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Thinking both Paul and Jessica were taken by the desert and all hopped up on violence after destroying the Atreides interlopers, House Harkonnen amplifies its attack on the Fremen, leading to a few remarkably staged battles between the warriors and soldiers. Villeneuve and his team deftly fill the first hour with battle sequences that counter the firepower of the Harkonnen military and the Fremen tribal combatants, who often literally emerge from the earth to destroy them. Bodies fall from the sky as enormous ships burst into flames in a way that feels nearly operatic. Amidst the chaos, Dave Bautista cannily sketches Rabban Harkonnen as a wartime leader who is in way over his bald head while Stellan Skargard leans even harder into a sort of blend between Nosferatu and Jabba the Hutt.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the battle between the Fremen and the Harkonnens for control of Arrakis serves as the backdrop for “Dune: Part Two,” Paul’s arc from nervous young man at the beginning of the first film to potential leader plays out in the foreground. A Fremen tribal leader named Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is convinced that Paul Atreides is the chosen one that has been foretold among his people for generations. Even as so much of the mythology points to Paul’s savior role, the Emo King tries to blend into the Fremen, forming a relationship with a young warrior named Chani (Zendaya). Paul passes the tests put in front of him by the Fremen, takes on the tribal name of Muad’Dib, and vows vengeance against the Harkonnens who were behind his father’s death.\n",
    "\n",
    "On another planet, an Emperor named Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) counsels with his daughter Irulan (Florence Pugh) and a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling) on the state of Arrakis. It’s revealed early on that Shaddam basically sent House Atreides to its destruction, meaning he’s on that vengeance list that Paul’s been keeping, while Irulan serves as a sort-of narrator for “Dune: Part Two,” dictating some of the political developments into a device that’s really designed to keep audiences with the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the interstellar politics aren’t enough, writers Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts inject a nice dose of religious fanaticism for the inevitable think pieces too. Lady Jessica becomes a powerful religious figure of her own among the Fremen, guiding her son’s ascendance in a manner that feels nefarious and unsettling. “Dune: Part Two” is not a traditional hero’s journey in that it’s constantly questioning if being led by an outsider from another culture is the right move—Chani sure doesn’t think so, and Zendaya subtly finds notes to make viewers wonder what a happy ending would be for these characters. As Jessica and Paul learn more about Fremen history and culture, they threaten not to lead it as much as dismantle and own it. There’s a big difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the plotting in “Part Two” is undeniably richer than the first film, its greatest assets are once again on a craft level. Greig Fraser, who won the Oscar for cinematography the first time, tops his work there with stunning use of color and light. It’s in the manner the sun hits Chalamet’s face at a certain angle or the wildly different palettes that differentiate the Harkonnens and the Fremen. The browns and blues of the desert culture don’t feel arid as much as grounded and tactile, while the Harkonnen world is so devoid of color that it’s often literally black and white—even what look like fireworks pop like someone throwing colorless paint at a wall. Hans Zimmer’s Oscar-winning score felt a bit overdone to me in the first film, but he smartly differentiates the cultures here, finding more metallic sounds for the cold Harkonnens to balance against the heated score for the Fremen. Finally, the effects and sound design feel denser this time, and the fight choreography reminds one how poorly this has been done in other blockbuster films.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for performers, Chalamet is likely to be the most divisive element, often feeling a bit flat for someone believed to be the Neo of this world. However, those choices add up in a way that makes thematic sense, enhancing the uncertainty of Paul’s rise. Zendaya is solid—although she lacks chemistry with Chalamet that would have helped—but it’s Ferguson’s slippery performance and Bardem’s playful one that really add flavors here that weren’t in the first outing. Finally, Austin Butler leans hard into the exaggerated role of Feyd-Rautha, playing the sociopathic nephew of the Baron with all the scenery-chewing intensity that a character like this needs to work, finding the emotional void to balance out against Chalamet’s tempestuous inner monologue.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Dune: Part Two” has been compared to “The Empire Strikes Back” in the run-up to its release, and that’s not quite right. The better comparison is “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,” another film that built on what we knew about the characters from the first film, added a few new ones, and really amplified a sense of continuous battle and danger. Like both films, a third chapter feels inevitable. Critics will have to come up with a new synonym for massive.\"\"\")"

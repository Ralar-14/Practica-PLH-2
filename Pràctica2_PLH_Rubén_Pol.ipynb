    "En conclusió, el model de MLP és bastant adequat, ja que la seva precisió és de 86%. Tot i això, el model de Random Forest és millor, ja que la seva precisió és de 86,25% i el temps de predicció és menor. Podem dir que tots dos models donen la funcionalitat esperada i que són relativament útils per a la predicció de textos. Ens agradaria poder provar amb més dades per veure si la precisió dels models millora i poder confiar més en les seves prediccions ja que actualment no són suficientment altes per considerar-los com a bons.\n",

Tot i això, no creiem que amb una accuracy del 64.5% sigui suficient per poder considerar el nostre model com a bo. Per tant, creiem que el nostre model encara té marge de millora i podria ser preferible utilitzar més dades o optar per un model supervisat."

    "Es pot veure com els errors comesos són bastant lògics ja que la majoria dels textos que han estat mal classificats són textos ambigus, textos amb diàleg de la pròpia pel·lícula, textos amb sarcasme o textos amb una expectativa molt alta de la pel·lícula. Per tant, podem dir que el nostre model ha fet un bon treball en general però té dificultats a la hora de barrejar paraules positives amb paraules negatives en un mateix text.\n",

    "<h4><u>Model no supervisat</u></h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Al veure els errors del nostre model, podem veure que la majoria dels textos que han estat mal classificats són textos que el model ha considerat com a neutres. Això pot ser degut a que aquests textos poden ser més difícils de classificar ja que poden tenir matisos que els fan semblar més positius o més negatius. El sentiment score d'aquests textos pot ser més proper a 0, cosa que pot haver causat la confusió del model. Tot i això, els errors no segueixen cap patró clar que haguem pogut identificar, per tant, no podem dir amb seguretat per què el model ha fallat en aquests casos. El fet de que el model no sigui supervisat pot haver causat aquesta manca de claredat en els errors ja que no hi ha un procés d'entrenament i correcció del model on podriem haver ajustat els paràmetres per millorar la seva precisió. Per últim, l'ús de Lesk pot haver fet que la desambiguació de les paraules sigui incorrecta, cosa que hauria pogut causar errors en la predicció del sentiment score dels textos."

    "Per millorar els models, podríem provar de fer un preprocessat més exhaustiu. Per això hauriem d'eliminar tot allò que no descriguís la pel·lícula en si, com ara els diàlegs de la pròpia pel·lícula. Això podria ajudar a millorar la precisió del model ja que així els textos no serien tan ambigus. \n",

    "Per altra banda, per millorar el segon model, podriem utilitzar eines alternatives a Lesk, per intentar millorar el procès de desambigüació de les paraules. També podriem considerar les paraules que no es trobèssin en el senti synset, sumant-li un pes extra per poder-les tenir en compte en el càlcul del sentiment score.\n",
    "Potser podriem classificar les paraules com a positives(1) o negatives(0) en comptes de valors numèrics positius i negatius. Això ajudaria a fer que les dades estiguéssin millor distribuides i no tant centrades al voltant de 0, cosa que podria haver causat la confusió del model.\n",
